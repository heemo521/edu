Audit of Repository vs MVP Requirements

1. Core Functionality: Personalized AI Tutoring
   - FastAPI backend supports multiple conversation threads per user and maintains message history using summarization logic.
   - Conversations can include user goals; feedback endpoints exist, but dynamic style adjustment is not implemented.

2. Structured Curriculum & Study Materials
   - Study materials and goal templates load from JSON files at startup.
   - Goal templates can generate goals, but interactive assignments or quizzes are absent.

3. Self-Improving Loop & Progress Tracking
   - Progress and feedback endpoints record user activity.
   - Automatic difficulty adjustment and visual progress dashboards are not implemented.

4. Intelligent Agent & Prompt Engine
   - The tutor integrates a local LLaMA model via Ollama with a configurable system prompt file.
   - Modular prompt scaffolding and support for interchangeable models remain limited.

5. Fullstack MVP: Robust, Usable, Deployable
   - React frontend, FastAPI backend, Dockerfile, and docker-compose are provided.
   - SQLite is used instead of PostgreSQL, and one-click deployment is incomplete.

6. Developer Experience & Maintainability
   - Repository includes tests, requirements, and a README.
   - Test coverage targets, contribution guides, and a roadmap are missing.

7. Readiness for Launch & User Feedback
   - Registration flow and goal templates offer initial onboarding.
   - Analytics, usage tracking, and bug-report channels are not yet implemented.
